### Portfolio

I'm Finn Meffe, an economics student at the University of Notre Dame. My primary research interests are in urban economics: I am particularly interested in quantitatvely modelling intra-city spatial dynamics, as well as the political economy of urban growth. This portfolio contains a representative sample of recent work.

#### Relevant Technical Skills: R, Stata, Python, Matlab, SQL

### Projects

#### Honors Thesis - Fragmentation and firm choice: The effects of municipal decentralization on firm-level agglomeration economies

I explore the relationship between the political arrangments within U.S. metropolitan areas (often referred to as a type of "tapestry" or "mosaic" of local jurisdictions) and the arrangment of firms across space: does local competition act as a barrier to clustering of economic activity? My identification strategy uses the "small streams" approach pioneered by Hoxby (2000) as a source of exogenous variation in political borders, which I regress against a set of constructed global agglomeration measures at the metropolitan level. 

#### Term Paper - Urbanization and democracy: primate cities as democratic incubators

This term paper examines the role of urbanization in fostering democratic movements. I make use of the V-Dem dataset to capture democratic indices, and UN World Urbanization Prospects data for panel data on urbanization. I adopt various econometric strategies to solve persistent endogeneity/reverse causality issues: lagged regression, instrumental variables, and event study.
